##Magic-Music-Player
====
This project is aim to design a real-time gesture-based Magic Music System, capable of adding sound effects (including tone and/or volume) in real time using defined hand gestures.

#Main Function
----
Export source from Mobile phone/PC;<br>
Equipped Control UI on mobile device; <br>
Change music tone/volume by hand gestures in the process of playing music.

#Hardware
----
Graphical User Interface: Mobile Phone<br>
Communication: Bluetooth Module<br>
Micro Processor: Raspberry Pi<br>
Sensors of Wearable Gloves: Accelerometer<br>
Speaker: Audio Player<br>

#Software
----
Communication system to realize wireless connection bewteen mobile phone and raspberry pi.<br>
Marchine learning model to classify hand gestures.<br>
Digital Signal Processing algorithm to process the input song.<br>
(Maybe concurrent programming is needed to guarantee the response time.)<br>
